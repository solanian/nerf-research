# NeRF-pytorch


[NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. Here are some videos generated by this repository (pre-trained models are provided below):

This project is a faithful PyTorch implementation of [NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) that **reproduces** the results while running **1.3 times faster**. The code is based on authors' Tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/bmild/nerf), and has been tested to match it numerically. 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch.git
cd nerf-pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<details>
  <summary> Dependencies (click to expand) </summary>
  
  ## Dependencies
  - PyTorch 1.4
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - imageio
  - imageio-ffmpeg
  - configargparse
  
The LLFF data loader requires ImageMagick.

You will also need the [LLFF code](http://github.com/fyusion/llff) (and COLMAP) set up to compute poses if you want to run on your own real data.

## How To Run?

### Quick Start

Download data for two example datasets: `lego` and `fern`
```
bash download_example_data.sh
```

To train a low-res `lego` NeRF:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/lego.txt
```

To train a low-res `fern` NeRF:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/fern.txt
```

To train NeRF on different datasets: 

```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.

To test NeRF trained on different datasets: 

```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt --render_only
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.


### Pre-trained Models

You can download the pre-trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jIr8dkvefrQmv737fFm2isiT6tqpbTbv). Place the downloaded directory in `./logs` in order to test it later. See the following directory structure for an example:

```
├── logs 
│   ├── fern_test
│   ├── flower_test  # downloaded logs
│   ├── trex_test    # downloaded logs
```

### Reproducibility 

Tests that ensure the results of all functions and training loop match the official implentation are contained in a different branch `reproduce`. One can check it out and run the tests:
```
git checkout reproduce
py.test
```
